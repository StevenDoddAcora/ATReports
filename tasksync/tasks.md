Auto Exposure Import is only processing the first line and updating the first customer, but no more. What is the issue? Is something missing? Using Powershell check C:\Users\steven.dodd\Documents\git\A0177_ACO00002 to see if something is still missing? Or is that intended functionality and the csv file is wrong?
Can you do a search online to see if there is a difference in how Business Central and NAV process multi line files
How does the ACO_QuantumImportMtg in this project compare to the ACO_QuantumImportMtg of C:\Users\steven.dodd\Documents\git\A0177_ACO00002 (check with Powershell)
